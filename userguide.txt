Floyd–Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd–Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

It works for:

Directed or undirected graphs

Graphs with positive or negative edge weights

Graphs with negative weights (but no negative cycles)

Core Idea

Instead of finding shortest paths from a single source (like Dijkstra), Floyd–Warshall computes the shortest distances between every pair of vertices.

It incrementally improves the solution by considering each vertex as an intermediate node.

For each pair of vertices (i, j), the algorithm checks whether going through an intermediate vertex k gives a shorter path:

dist[i][j]=min(dist[i][j],dist[i][k]+dist[k][j])

This update is repeated for all vertices as intermediates.

Algorithm Steps

Initialize a distance matrix dist

dist[i][j] = weight(i, j) if edge exists

dist[i][i] = 0

dist[i][j] = ∞ if no edge

For each vertex k (as intermediate):

For each pair (i, j):
