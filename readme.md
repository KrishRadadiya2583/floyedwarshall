-- this is a project based on floyed warshall algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph. The algorithm works by iteratively updating a distance matrix that represents the shortest path between each pair of vertices.


-- The implementation of the floyed warshall algorithm in this project is done in Python. The code defines a function called `floyd_warshall` that takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix and returns a distance matrix with the shortest path lengths between all pairs of vertices.

-- techniques used in this project include:
-- 1. Dynamic Programming: The algorithm uses dynamic programming to iteratively update the distance matrix based on previously computed shortest paths.
-- 2. Matrix Representation: The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which allows for
--    efficient access and updates to the distance values.
-- 3. Iterative Approach: The algorithm iteratively updates the distance matrix for each pair of vertices, ensuring that all possible paths are considered.

-- tech stack used in this project includes:
--1. node js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for executing the code.
--2. JavaScript: The programming language used to implement the floyed warshall algorithm and create the necessary functions for graph representation and distance calculation.
--3.ejs (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine used to generate HTML pages dynamically based on the data processed by the algorithm. It allows for rendering the results of the shortest path calculations in a user-friendly format.
